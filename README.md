# Taxonomy-Visualiser
D3 project that visualises GBIF and NBN taxonomies via web services. This was created for the FSC Tomorrow's Biodiversity project by Rich Burkmar in order to try out some D3 features and to demonstrate the utility of web service APIs on taxonomic databases such as GBIF and NBN.

To implement this project with minimum changes, you need to honour the file structure coded into the html and javascript files. So to do that, create a folder '/sites/vis/taxv1' under the root of your website and copy all the contents of the taxv1
